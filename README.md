# hardware-modular-synth
An electronics project about making modules for a hardware modular synth

A project to learn and to enjoy making electronic stuff. Basically the project contains veroboard layouts based on the modules from the Youtube channel 'Modular in a Week' by Kristian Bl√•sol. Thank you a lot for all the work you have done Kristian!
